## Papers

Each paper lives in [`papers/_posts/`](https://github.com/Oviedo-Lab/oviedolab.org/tree/master/papers/_posts).  File names, used to construct permalinks, include a short title, for example [`2011-07-20-functional-asymmetry.md`](https://github.com/Oviedo-Lab/oviedolab.org/blob/main/papers/_posts/2011-07-20-functional-asymmetry.md). Papers have the following YAML metadata:

```

```

Tags `layout`, `title`, `image`, `authors`, `year`, `ref`, `journal` are required.  Tags `pdf`, `supplement`, `github` are optional.  The image should be a 120x120 pixel tile.

## Team

Each team member has a Markdown file in [`team/_posts/`](https://github.com/Oviedo-Lab/oviedolab.org/tree/master/team/_posts).  File names are join date followed by first and last name, like [`2010-09-13-hysell-oviedo.md`](https://github.com/Oviedo-Lab/oviedolab.org/blob/master/team/_posts/2010-09-13-hysell-oviedo.md).  

A full YAML example follows:

```
