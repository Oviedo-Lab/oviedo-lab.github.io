The Oviedo lab is seeking a postdoctoral researcher (NIH-funded) to study the development of the auditory cortex in mice. Specifically, the maturation of neural circuits involved in processing social calls. Our long-term goal is to understand how the development of communication circuits go awry in mouse models of human communication disorders. Experience in electrophysiology is preferred but any talented candidate will be considered. Experience in patch-clamping, voltage-dye imaging and MATLAB programming are desirable. Our lab is in a new state of the art science building on scenic Hamilton heights in Manhattan. Come and be part of the unparalleled neuroscience community in the New York area: we have collaborations with labs at NYU and Stony Brook University.


Interested applicants should email a CV, a cover letter, and contact information for three references to:
