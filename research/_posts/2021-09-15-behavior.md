An animalâ€™s brain must perform the challenging tasks of recognizing, categorizing, and assigning communicative importance to sounds. We use behavioral tasks to test the auditory perceptual abilities of rodents to gain mechanistic insight into their communicative functions. In the video clip below we show an example of a mouse performing a 2-alternative forced choice task to discriminate two tones.
