Human studies have made great progress in advancing our understanding of the global computations required for processing speech, and animal models offer the opportunity to discover evolutionarily conserved mechanisms for decoding these signals. In this review article, we describe some of the most well-established speech decoding computations from human studies and describe animal research designed to reveal potential circuit mechanisms underlying these processes. Human and animal brains must perform the challenging tasks of rapidly recognizing, categorizing, and assigning communicative importance to sounds in a noisy environment. The instructions to these functions are found in the precise connections neurons make with one another. Therefore, identifying circuit-motifs in the auditory cortices and linking them to communicative functions is pivotal. We review recent advances in human recordings that have revealed the most basic unit of speech decoded by neurons is a phoneme, and consider circuit-mapping studies in rodents that have shown potential connectivity schemes to achieve this. Finally, we discuss other potentially important processing features in humans like lateralization, sensitivity to fine temporal features, and hierarchical processing. The goal is for animal studies to investigate neurophysiological and anatomical pathways responsible for establishing behavioral phenotypes that are shared between humans and animals. This can be accomplished by establishing cell types, connectivity patterns, genetic pathways and critical periods that are relevant in the development and function of social communication.",[],"20200129","10.3389/fncir.2020.00002","Frontiers in Neural Circuits","https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neural-circuits/articles/10.3389/fncir.2020.00002/full",true,"/src/lib/assets/publications/DemetriosNeophytou2020/DemetriosNeophytou2020-thumbnail.jpg","Figure 1 from the paper shows plausible connectivity motifs of phoneme detectors",[38],{"title":39,"authors":40,"abstract":45,"abstractHeadings":50,"yyyymmdd":55,"doi":56,"journal":57,"url":58,"isPreprint":19,"isReviewArticle":19,"thumbnail":59,"thumbnailSummary":60},"Effects of direct current stimulation on synaptic plasticity in a single neuron",[41,42,43,11,44],"Forouzan Farahani","Greg Kronberg","Mohamad FallahRad","Lucas C.

We hypothesized that the underlying recurrent neural dynamics would exhibit differential characteristic timescales corresponding to their hemispheric specialization. To investigate, we recorded spike trains from awake mice and estimated the network time constants using a statistical method to combine evidence from multiple weak signal-to-noise ratio neurons. We found longer temporal integration windows in the superficial layers of the right ACx compared to the left as predicted by stronger recurrent excitation.

This is particularly true in post-mitotic neurons, where deficiencies in DNA damage response proteins can result in severe neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders. One highly conserved factor involved in DNA repair is Mut-S Homolog 2 (Msh2), which is responsible for correcting base- base mismatches and insertion/deletion loops during cell proliferation. However, its role in mature neuronal function remains poorly understood. This study investigates the impact of Msh2 loss on sensory processing in a mouse model. Using electrophysiological and molecular assays, we identified significant deficits in cortical and thalamic sound processing in Msh2ᐨᐟᐨ mice. These deficits were linked to dysfunction of the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN), a brain region that critically regulates corticothalamic and thalamocortical activity. Our findings revealed increased oxidative damage, aberrant neuronal activity, and elevated parvalbumin (PV) expression in PVᐩ interneurons in the TRN of Msh2ᐨᐟᐨ mice. Additionally, we observed the presence of connexin plaques, indicating that disrupted gap junction formation may contribute to impaired TRN function. These results underscore the critical role of Msh2 in supporting the functionality of PVᐩ interneurons in the TRN, thereby profoundly influencing sensory processing pathways.

The study of these subpopulations in circuit function and behavior requires a toolkit to characterize and manipulate their activity in vivo. We have developed a novel set of reagents based on Pseudorabies Virus (PRV) for efficient and long-term genetic tagging of neurons based on their projection targets. By deleting IE180, the master transcriptional regulator in the PRV genome, we have produced a mutant virus capable of infection and transgene expression in neurons but unable to replicate in or spread from those neurons. IE180-null mutants showed no cytotoxicity, and infected neurons exhibited normal physiological function more than 45 days after infection, indicating the utility of these engineered viruses for chronic experiments. To enable rapid and convenient construction of novel IE180-null recombinants, we engineered a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) shuttle-vector system for moving new constructs into the PRV IE180-null genome. Using this system we generated an IE180-null recombinant virus expressing the site-specific recombinase Cre. This Cre-expressing virus (PRV-hSyn-Cre) efficiently and robustly infects neurons in vivo and activates transgene expression from Cre-dependent vectors in local and retrograde projecting populations of neurons in the mouse. We also generated an assortment of recombinant viruses expressing fluorescent proteins (mCherry, EGFP, ECFP).

Because of the voltage- and time-dependent conductances in the dendrites and soma, summation of synaptic inputs is complex. To examine summation of membrane potentials and firing rates, we performed whole-cell recordings from layer 5 cortical pyramidal neurons in acute slices of the rat's somatosensory cortex. We delivered subthreshold and suprathreshold stimuli at the soma and several sites on the apical dendrite, and injected inputs that mimic synaptic barrages at individual or distributed sites. We found that summation of subthreshold potentials differed from that of firing rates. Subthreshold summation was linear when barrages were small but became supralinear as barrages increased. When neurons were discharging repetitively the rules were more diverse. At the soma and proximal apical dendrite summation of the evoked firing rates was predominantly sublinear whereas in the distal dendrite summation ranged from supralinear to sublinear. In addition, the integration of inputs delivered at a single location differed from that of distributed inputs only for suprathreshold responses.
