I joined the Oviedo lab in 2018 as an undergrad and remained as a grad student in 2020 to continue pursuing my interests in auditory physiology and circuit dynamics. When the lab was moving to WashU in St. Louis in 2023, I opted to move as well to continue my project on the development of lateralized processes in the auditory cortex. In my time in the lab I’ve learned a variety of skills with my focus being on learning electrophysiology in both living animals and in slices. My broad interests are in studying cortical circuits and their contribution to function and behavior.",[17],{"type":18,"title":19,"url":20},"orcid","ORCID","https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1430-5951","DN"],"uses":{"params":["member"]}}]}
