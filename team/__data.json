Processing of conspecific vocalizations is lateralized in the human brain and other species, but functional significance, mechanisms, and ontogeny of lateralization have remained a mystery for over a century. My research group has focused on mice, which have become a viable model system to study evolutionarily conserved mechanisms of vocal communication thanks to growing evidence of their vocal repertoire’s complexity during social interactions and auditory plasticity triggered by parental experience.","My laboratory leverages the cutting-edge tools available in rodents to study circuitry in the context of species-specific vocalizations providing behavioral and computational constraints. Processing social calls requires simultaneously recognizing, categorizing, and assigning communicative importance to these fleeting signals. Lateralization—assigning specific computational tasks to each cerebral hemisphere for parallel processing—is an important strategy to solve this challenge. The novel approach of my research program has been to use lateralization as a comparative tool to reveal molecular, structural and functional differences between the left and right Auditory Cortices.","We have discovered lateralized processing of specific acoustic features in the mouse Auditory Cortex and identified circuit asymmetries that could support the necessary specialized computations. We plan to capitalize on these findings to determine the development and diversity of lateralized cortical specializations, and how they go awry in communication disorders.",[],"HO",{"isAlumni":3,"name":26,"title":27,"suffix":6,"includeSuffix":7,"education":28,"honorsAndAwards":34,"CV":35,"images":38,"biography":40,"externalLinks":42,"initials":55},"Michael Barkasi","Staff Scientist",[29,30,31,32,33],"2023, Postdoc, Harris Multisensory Integration Lab, York University","2018-2020, Postdoc, Network for Sensory Research, University of Toronto","2015, Ph.D., Philosophy, Rice University","2011, MA., Philosophy, Rice University","2009, BA., Philosophy, Kutztown University",[],{"title":36,"url":37},"Michael Barkasi CV","https://www.michaelbarkasi.com/curriculum-vitae/",[39],"/src/lib/assets/team/MichaelBarkasi/headshot_MichaelBarkasi_2024.jpg",[41],"Hi! I’m Mike. Catching the tail end of a new wave of empirically informed philosophy of perception in the 2000s, I completed my PhD at Rice studying the relationship between sensory information channels and perceptual consciousness. After a break from academics as an amateur track cyclist and youth cycling coach, I took a postdoc at the Network for Sensory Research in the Department of Philosophy, University of Toronto. As that postdoc wound down, I joined the Centre for Philosophy of Memory at Université Grenoble Alps as an associate member while launching a startup to explore the use of movement sonification in athletic training. I discovered I liked science more than business, so I shifted this work into a postdoc with Harris Multisensory Integration Lab at York University studying auditory feedback in motor control. Finding my way from Toronto to WashU, I’m now a staff scientist here at the lab. My technical expertise is in mathematical modelling, geometry, and high-performance computing. I’m interested in computational models of sensorimotor information processing, both at the circuit and representation levels. Philosophically, I’m interested in how this information processing gives rise to phenomenal consciousness. Within philosophy I’m best known for my novel work on how the interaction of sensory and mnemonic neural mechanisms afford us contact with the external world through our subjective internal experience.
