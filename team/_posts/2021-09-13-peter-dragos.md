I am a mathematically-inclined programmer based out of Manhattan, New York. I was brought on to the team at Oviedo Lab to assist with migrating aging electrophysiology hardware and software to modern versions, as well as manage a website migration from Wordpress to Github Pages.

In my non-computer related jobs, I am a freelance audio/visual technician running sound, lights, and video for live events ranging from community events, panels, and press conferences, to musical, theatrical, and dance acts.

Most of my free time is spend studying functional programming and mathematics.
