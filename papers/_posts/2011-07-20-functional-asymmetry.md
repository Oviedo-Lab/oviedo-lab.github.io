# Abstract

The primary auditory cortex (A1) is organized tonotopically, with neurons sensitive to high and 
low frequencies arranged in a rostro-caudal gradient. We used laser scanning photostimulation in 
acute slices to study the organization of local excitatory connections onto layers 2 and 3 (L2/3) of 
the mouse A1. Consistent with the organization of other cortical regions, synaptic inputs along the 
isofrequency axis (orthogonal to the tonotopic axis) arose predominantly within a column. 
Surprisingly, we found that local connections along the tonotopic axis differed from those along 
the isofrequency axis: some input pathways to L3 (but not L2) arose predominantly out-of-
column. In vivo cell-attached recordings revealed differences between the sound-responsiveness 
of neurons in L2 and L3. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that auditory cortical 
microcircuitry is specialized to the unique one-dimensional representation of frequency in the 
auditory cortex.
