<p>The City College of New Yorkâ€™s Cohen Library sponsors a Biology Animation Assistantship program with an interdisciplinary team of students with science and art backgrounds. The goal is to use student-created works as teaching tools in and out of the classroom. The team is led by Professor Hysell Oviedo from the Biology department, and Professor Ching-Jung Chen from the Visual Resources Library. To see our collection of science animations visit this <a href="http://ccnydigitalscholarship.org/science-animation/">website</a> and for interactive educational resources click <a href="https://ccnydss.github.io/bioanimation/">here</a>.</p>
