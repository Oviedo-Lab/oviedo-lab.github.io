<p>The left hemisphereâ€™s dominance in processing social communication has been known for
over a century, but the mechanisms underlying this lateralized cortical function are poorly
understood. Here, we compare the structure, function, and development of each auditory
cortex (ACx) in the mouse to look for specializations that may underlie lateralization. Using
Fos brain volume imaging, we found greater activation in the left ACx in response to voca-
lizations, while the right ACx responded more to frequency sweeps. In vivo recordings
identified hemispheric differences in spectrotemporal selectivity, reinforcing their functional
differences. We then compared the synaptic connectivity within each hemisphere and dis-
covered lateralized circuit-motifs that are hearing experience-dependent. Our results suggest
a specialist role for the left ACx, focused on facilitating the detection of specific vocalization
features, while the right ACx is a generalist with the ability to integrate spectrotemporal
features more broadly.</p>
