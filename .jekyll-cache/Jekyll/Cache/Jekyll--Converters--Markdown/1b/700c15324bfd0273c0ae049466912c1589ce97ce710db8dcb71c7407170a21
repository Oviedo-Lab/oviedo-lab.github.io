I"_<p>I am a mathematically-inclined programmer based out of Manhattan, New York. I was brought on to the team at Oviedo Lab to assist with migrating aging electrophysiology hardware and software to modern versions, as well as manage a website migration from Wordpress to Github Pages.</p>

<p>In my non-computer related jobs, I am a freelance audio/visual technician running sound, lights, and video for live events ranging from community events, panels, and press conferences, to musical, theatrical, and dance acts.</p>

<p>Most of my free time is spend studying functional programming and mathematics.</p>
